[Spike truing sheet](https://github.com/cvoica/bike/blob/main/Spike_truing.xlsx ) was created to assist me for the spike truing. Tension and deviation were manually measured. By changing the tension I got the deviation to the desired values (less than 0.7mm at the end).
In the process the graphical representations helped identifying which measures (increase or decrease tension) to take on which spoke. 

The tension limits were taken into account as well as the requirement that the rotor tension must be lower than the right side tension.

The process was incremental, starting with the initial measurements and graphs (faded colors) to change the tensions and then measure them again: new tension + deviation to redraw the graph.
